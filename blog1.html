        This blog goes into how I built my personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        I started by creating a wireframe and planning the structure of my sections: Home, About, Projects,
        Skills, Blogs, and Contact.

      <p>
        The main challenge was making it responsive and attractive on all devices. I used Flexbox and media queries,
        and later added animations using CSS transitions and JavaScript's scroll events.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hosted it using GitHub Pages and learned how to use `git`, `commit`, and `push` from my local VS Code.
        This project taught me not just frontend skills, but also version control, deployment, and debugging techniques.
