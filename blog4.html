      <p>
        Hackathons are intense, creative sprints that challenge developers to build meaningful solutions under pressure. For me, they’re not just competitions — they’re growth accelerators. After attending several as a solo hacker and in teams, I've built a system that helps me stay calm, focused, and productive.
      </p>

      <h3>🧠 Mindset First</h3>
      <p>
        My first step is always mindset. I treat every hackathon as a learning opportunity. Winning is great, but I focus more on:
        <ul>
          <li>Creating value</li>
          <li>Learning something new</li>
          <li>Collaborating efficiently</li>
        </ul>
        When I enter with curiosity and not ego, everything flows better.
      </p>

      <h3>⚒️ Tools I Set Up in Advance</h3>
      <p>
        Before the hackathon starts, I prepare a basic project scaffold. This might include:
        <ul>
          <li>Frontend (React + Tailwind, or simple HTML/CSS/JS)</li>
          <li>Backend (Express.js + MongoDB or Firebase)</li>
          <li>Boilerplate with login/signup, routing, and a reusable UI kit</li>
        </ul>
        This gives me a 3-hour head start and lets me focus on the core solution instead of setup.
      </p>

      <h3>⏱️ Managing Time</h3>
      <p>
        Time is your real currency in a hackathon. I usually split the hours like this:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>20% Planning:</strong> Understand the problem, brainstorm, assign roles</li>
          <li><strong>60% Building:</strong> MVP development with clear priorities</li>
          <li><strong>20% Demo Prep:</strong> UI polish, presentation slides, GitHub README</li>
        </ul>
        I avoid perfectionism early. “Done” is better than “perfect.”
      </p>

      <h3>📦 Version Control & Communication</h3>
      <p>
        I always set up a GitHub repo with proper branches (e.g., `dev`, `master`) and push regularly. For teamwork, I use Notion, Trello, or even WhatsApp to stay synced.
      </p>

      <h3>🚫 Common Mistakes I Avoid</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Trying to do too much — I always simplify the idea to the smallest useful version.</li>
          <li>Ignoring the pitch — I treat the final 5-minute demo as seriously as the code.</li>
          <li>Skipping rest — Short breaks improve focus and teamwork.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>💡 Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        Hackathons are like mental gyms. They stretch your limits, connect you with amazing peers, and sharpen your creativity. If you're a developer, I highly recommend joining one — not for the prize, but for the priceless experience.
