        Designing and deploying my portfolio website was one of the most rewarding parts of my web development journey. I started with just a few HTML and CSS files and slowly transformed it into a clean, interactive, and responsive portfolio.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built sections like Home, About, Projects, Blogs, and Contact using pure HTML5 and CSS3. Animations, hover effects, and responsiveness were added with thoughtful use of Flexbox, transitions, and media queries.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I learned:
        <ul>
          <li>✅ Structuring HTML semantically</li>
          <li>✅ Writing reusable CSS classes</li>
          <li>✅ Making it responsive for mobile & desktop</li>
          <li>✅ Hosting using GitHub Pages and managing with Git CLI</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The real magic was pushing it all live through GitHub — using just the terminal! This helped me understand version control better and made my site accessible to the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I continue to improve this site regularly, and I plan to add animations, light/dark modes, and a CMS-backed blog system in the future.
