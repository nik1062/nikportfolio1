      <p>
        In college, side projects are my favorite teachers. I truly believe that developers grow fastest when they step out of tutorials and start building real things — even if they’re small, scrappy, and imperfect.
      </p>

      <h3>🚀 Projects Teach What Books Can’t</h3>
      <p>
        When I built my portfolio site, I didn’t just practice HTML and CSS — I learned deployment, responsive design, Git, debugging, performance optimization, and user feedback. One simple project taught me more than an entire semester.
      </p>

      <h3>💡 Ideas Come From Problems</h3>
      <p>
        My best project ideas come from daily life. A friend couldn’t find good notes? I made a study app. Wanted to track habits? I made a habit tracker with streak logic. Solving small problems builds confidence — and soon, you’re solving bigger ones.
      </p>

      <h3>🛠️ Tools Get Real Practice</h3>
      <p>
        I used Firebase, MongoDB, Tailwind, APIs, and even OpenAI — not because a course told me, but because my side project *needed* them. That urgency is the best motivator.
      </p>

      <h3>🎯 Portfolio > Resume</h3>
      <p>
        When I applied for internships, my side projects spoke louder than my GPA. Recruiters loved seeing live demos, GitHub activity, and creative thinking. Side projects build a portfolio that showcases initiative, consistency, and passion.
      </p>

      <h3>🔥 My Advice</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Start simple — even a To-Do app can be powerful if done well.</li>
        <li>Don’t chase “unique” ideas. Chase *useful* ones.</li>
        <li>Finish what you start — and ship it.</li>
        <li>Write about your process. It makes you stand out.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Every side project I build makes me 10x better than before. It’s the fastest way to learn, stand out, and build your developer identity. So don’t wait — build something today.
